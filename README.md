# unit-conversion-tool

Hi!

This repository will showcase what I've learned in the Treehouse PHP Basics: Unit Converter course.
I will be creating a unit converstion tool that will allow me to convert kilograms to pounds, kilometers to miles, and ounces to cups. This was extra practice from the course where we created a unit conversion tool converting pounds into kilograms and miles into kilometers.
